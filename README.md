# decor - DEC Owners' Registry

This is the codebase of decor, a community-driven registry of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computers and their owners.
It is based on Ruby on Rails and was developed with the help of <a href="https://claude.ai">claude.ai</a>.

The beta version of decor is available at <a href="https://decorweb.net/">decorweb.net</a>.

decor can easily be adapted for collections of hardware of other manufacturers, or even for a private inventory of one's computer collection.

This software is free, and the only restriction is that it, and all of its derivatives, are to remain free.
