# decor/test/fixtures/computer_conditions.yml
# version 1.0
# Renamed from conditions.yml as part of the conditions → computer_conditions
# table rename (Session 7, February 25, 2026).
#
# Replaces: decor/test/fixtures/conditions.yml (delete that file)
#
# Fixture labels (original, original_repaired, modified, built) are unchanged
# so that computers.yml references continue to work without any label changes —
# computers.yml only needs condition: → computer_condition: key rename.
