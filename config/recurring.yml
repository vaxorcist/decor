# decor/config/recurring.yml - version 1.1
# Solid Queue recurring job configuration.
# Changes from v1.0:
# - Added send_invite_reminders: runs InviteReminderJob daily at 8am
#   to send one-time reminder emails to invitees past the 20-day threshold.

# examples:
#   periodic_cleanup:
#     class: CleanSoftDeletedRecordsJob
#     queue: background
#     args: [ 1000, { batch_size: 500 } ]
#     schedule: every hour
#   periodic_cleanup_with_command:
#     command: "SoftDeletedRecord.due.delete_all"
#     priority: 2
#     schedule: at 5am every day

production:
  clear_solid_queue_finished_jobs:
    command: "SolidQueue::Job.clear_finished_in_batches(sleep_between_batches: 0.3)"
    schedule: every hour at minute 12

  # Send one-time reminder emails to invitees who have not registered after 20 days.
  # InviteReminderJob is idempotent — each invite only ever receives one reminder.
  send_invite_reminders:
    class: InviteReminderJob
    queue: default
    schedule: every day at 8am
