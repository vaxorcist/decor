# decor/config/database.yml - version 1.1
# Added foreign_keys: true to default section (inherited by all environments).
# This enables SQLite PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON per connection, ensuring that
# all FK constraints defined in migrations are actually enforced at the DB level.
# Without this, SQLite silently accepts invalid FK values despite FK definitions.

# SQLite. Versions 3.8.0 and up are supported.

#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
